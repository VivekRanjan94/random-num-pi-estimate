# Estimating &pi; Using Random Numbers and Probabilities

In mathematics, pi (written as the Greek letter for p, or π) is the ratio of the circumference of any circle to the diameter of that circle.

This website uses randomly generated numbers to estimate the value of π by using the property that the probability of any number two numbers being coprime is 6 / π2.

If many random number pairs are created (say 10000), and the number of coprime pairs are counted, the probability that any number is coprime can be approximated

### P(pair is coprime) = number of coprime pairs / total number of pairs

### => π = √6 / √P
